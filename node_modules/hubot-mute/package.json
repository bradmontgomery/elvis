  "readme": "# Hubot Mute\n\nAllows channels to mute Hubot if quiet is required for whatever reasons. Hubot will not respond to any commands in a muted channel (other than `mute` commands).\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexhouse/hubot-mute.png)](https://travis-ci.org/alexhouse/hubot-mute) [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/hubot-codinglove.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/hubot-codinglove)\n\n## Usage\n\nList all channels currently muted: `hubot mute list`\nMute the channel you're on: `hubot mute`\nMute a specific channel: `hubot mute #development`\nMute **all** channels: `hubot mute all`\n\nUnmute by swapping `mute` for `unmute` above.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThis script requires the env variable `HUBOT_MUTE_ROOM_PREFIX` to be set. This is used in determining how to respond to the channel.\n\nFor example, if you're on IRC or Slack you'll probably want this setting as `#`. Basecamp should be able to leave it as blank.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd the package `\"hubot-mute\": \"*\"` as a dependency in your Hubot package.json file. Then add `\"hubot-mute\"` to the list in the `external-scripts.json` file.\n",
